# This project creates a fully functional ELK stack for monitoring.
## It is done using ansible
### The project consists of the main.yml file which instructs which folders/ELK stack properties to use.
### To ensure that the code is built using the smallest functional segments, the stack was separated.
### THere is the main elasticsearch, then filebeat and logzio, java, kibana and finally metricbeat.
